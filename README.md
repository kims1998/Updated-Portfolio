# Updated-Portfolio

Within the second time doing the Professional Portfolio, I have made many changes from the original portfolio.
    The prior professional portfolio was not properly deploying the correct CSS and HTML styles.

As time had went on during the course, I had slowly been working on creating a properly functioning portfolio that will display the information of myself.


With the new portfolio:
    -All of the Index.html has been updated. Compared to the old portfolio, it does not resemble really in any way.
    -Along with the CSS file, the new portfolio has nothing similar to the old portfolio.

For the next time the portfolio is updated, there will be comments and more organization within the CSS in order to figure out where all the CSS is placed.
